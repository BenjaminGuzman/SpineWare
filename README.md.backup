This software is under the GPLv3 License, thus you're free to modify and improve the code.

We love Open Source Software and GNU/Linux so most of the code is tested in this platform, but we believe is part of the freedom of the user to choose what software to use and in which platform, therefore **all help to bring SpineWare to Windows and MacOS users is welcome**. A great advantage is that SpineWare is written in Java.
