posture_checker_description=<html><p>This will use your camera to see if you're in a good posture or not.</p><br/>\
  <p>The check will be done in 3 steps</p>\
  <ul>\
    <li><b>Distance to the monitor calculation</b>: A naive approach to calculate the distance of your face with respect to the monitor</li>\
    <li><b>Proximity detection with respect to the monitor</b>: To vaguely calculate how much monitor light you are exposed to</li>\
    <li><b>Position with respect to the camera</b>: To ensure you see the monitor in a not so obtuse angle</li>\
    </ul><br/>\
  <p><b>My privacy is in risk if I use this feature?</b></p><br/>\
  <p>No! All the processing is done locally and no information is shared to anyone</p>\
  <p>You can be sure of that if you check SpineWare's source code (go to Help section)</p><br/>\
  <p><b>Will this slow down my computer?</b></p><br/>\
  <p>Probably, but this configuration panel uses a lot more resources than the background process</p>\
  <p>The good news is that you don't have to this configuration often</p>\
